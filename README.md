## How to claim a sub section to write about
We claim a section in the report by writing our name behind the heading and pushing it to the git. This helps us also to find a fair balance in writing distribution

## Topic
Users' satisfaction about Dalarna University's Homepage

## Research Question(s)
Focus on functionality:

1. If "find personal" is accessed, then the path is intuitive and quick?

2. If "find personal" page is visited, then the required data is found quickly?

3. If "find personal" page is visited, then a up-to-date front-end is displayed?
